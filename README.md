## How the Contact Form Works

1. **Form Class:** `src/Form/ContactType.php` defines the fields.
2. **Controller:** Handles displaying and processing the form.
3. **Template:** Renders the form and shows a thank you message after submission.

To try it:
- Go to `/contact`, fill out the form, and submit.
- Youâ€™ll see a success message if all fields are valid.

## Possible Next Steps to enhance the project and deepen the understanding
- Make the Projects page dynamic.
- Add email sending or message storage for the contact form.
- Improve styling with CSS or a framework.
- Deploy my portfolio online.
